/*  Task:
Write three functions swap_v(int,int), swap_r(int&,int&), and swap_cr(const int&, const int&). 
Each should have the body { int temp; temp = a, a=b; b=temp; } where a and b are the names of the arguments.
Try calling each swap like this

int x = 7;
int y = 9;
swap_?(x,y); // replace ? by v, r, or cr
swap_?(7,9);
const int cx = 7;
const int cy = 9;
swap_?(cx,cy);
swap_?(7.7,9.9);
double dx = 7.7;
double dy = 9.9;
swap_?(dx,dy);

Which functions and calls compiled, and why? 
After each swap that compiled, print the value of the arguments after the call to see if they were actually swapped.
If you are surprised by a result, consult ยง8swap_cr(const int&, const int&)swap_cr(const int&, const int&).6.
